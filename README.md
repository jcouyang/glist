![A screenshot of your spankin' package](https://raw.github.com/jcouyang/glist/master/media/glist.gif)

glist let you list and edit gist within atom.

Install
=======
```
apm install glist
```

How to Use
==========
there is kind of =glist mode= concept if you've use the emacs gist mode before, you can =ctrl-x ctrl-g= to toggle on/off =glist mode=

1. just toggle on `glist` you'll redirected to your gists folder, and update all your gists into the folder.

2. `cmd-t` to find any gist you wanna edit

3. `ctrl-x ctrl-s` will both save your gist locally and update on gist.github.com

now I can use Atom and gist in place of evernote :beer:

> thanks to gist-it give me inspiration, I fork and build this base on that code, added lot more features and tests.
